**ðŸŒ² Random Forest Classification:**

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of the Random Forest Classification algorithm using Scikit-learn. It is used to classify data by building an ensemble of decision trees and aggregating their outputs for better accuracy.


ðŸ“Œ Key Components:

Loading and preprocessing the dataset

Splitting data into training and testing sets

Building and training a RandomForestClassifier

Making predictions

Evaluating model performance using:

    Accuracy score

    Confusion matrix

    Classification report

Tuning hyperparameters (if applicable)


ðŸ›  Libraries Used:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization, if included)


ðŸŽ¯ Ideal For:

Learning how ensemble models work

Comparing performance with other classification algorithms

Applying Random Forest to real-world classification tasks
